// remapFinalizeCitations rewrites each fragment's [n] markers from the numbering
// THAT TURN saw into the numbering of the final merged pool.
//
// Why this is necessary: [n] markers are not assigned once per session. They are
// assigned once per TURN, positionally, over the evidence pool as it existed at
// that moment (internal/agent/tool_summarize_chunk.go: sort, then
// CitationIndex = i+1). So the ordinal a marker means is a function of which
// evidence rows existed during that turn.
//
// Turn 1 fetches #alpha (today 10:00-11:00) -> 8 messages, indices 1-8, and the
// reply cites [3] = alpha's 3rd message. Turn 3 fetches #beta (last week) -> 12
// messages with EARLIER timestamps, so turn 3's pool sorts beta into 1-12 and
// alpha shifts to 13-20. Finalize merges both replies against ONE pool built at
// the newest reply — turn 3's numbering — and turn 1's preserved [3] now names a
// beta message. BuildCitations only clamps OUT-OF-RANGE indices; 3 is in range,
// so nothing is dropped and nothing is logged. The deliverable ships confidently
// wrong attribution, which this file's own comments (and every reviewer) call
// worse than a missing citation.
//
// The remap resolves each marker through MESSAGE IDENTITY (channel_id:message_seq)
// rather than through its ordinal: turn pool index -> identity -> final pool index.
//
// SCOPING (R4 blocking 1). The rewrite is applied through
// citation.RewriteMarkers, NOT through a bare regex over the body. This function
// is the first place in the repo that REWRITES a body on the "every bracketed
// integer is a citation" assumption; everything before it only READ the markers,
// which is why the assumption was survivable. It is not survivable here:
// `待办共 [3] 项` renumbered to `待办共 [11] 项`, `items[0]` inside a fenced block
// deleted, `GB/T 7714 [2020]` deleted and `[1](url)` turned into `(url)` are all
// reachable, and the consolidation prompt then orders the model to preserve the
// corrupted text verbatim. The repo already ruled on exactly this hazard in
// handler.stripUnresolvedCitationMarkers (R11 Q5); citation.RewriteMarkers is
// that ruling, extracted so both sites share ONE definition.
//
// FAIL CLOSED, ASYMMETRICALLY — and the asymmetry is the point:
//   - a token that RESOLVES to a real turn-pool identity but is absent from the
//     final pool is DROPPED. It is a real citation, and a wrong one is worse
//     than a missing one.
//   - a token that does NOT resolve is LEFT BYTE-IDENTICAL. It is not a citation
//     this function can account for, so it is prose until proven otherwise;
//     an untouched `[2020]` is correct content, a deleted one is data loss.
//     (Round 3 deleted these. That was the defect.)
//
// KNOWN WEAKNESS — this RE-DERIVES each turn's numbering instead of reading an
// authoritative record of it. PersistEvidence upserts with
// ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE evidence = VALUES(evidence) and deliberately does NOT
// refresh created_at, so a row rewritten after the fact re-derives differently
// than the turn actually saw. Reading the frozen per-run manifests
// (internal/agent/citation_manifest.go) would remove the re-derivation entirely;
// it is not available in v0 because agent_message has no run_id column and
// agent_citation_manifest is keyed by run_id, so a reply cannot be linked to its
// own turn's manifest without a schema change.

// assistant reply (internal/agent/runner.go: tool messages are appended to
// newMsgs, then the answer). So `tool row id < reply id` is an exact,
// tie-free answer to "did this handle exist when that reply was written" — the
// same axis the freeze bound itself is expressed in.
//
// FALLBACK, and the exact scope of the degrade: a row whose handle has no tool
// row (orphan evidence — the documented case where a chat step fails after
// PersistEvidence but before AppendMessages, agent_summary_citations.go) has no
// id to compare, so it falls back to created_at. Same-second rows are still
// INCLUDED there, because a turn's own evidence is stamped in the same second as
// its own reply: excluding it would drop the citations of every ordinary
// single-turn session, which is a far larger quality loss than the defect.

//
// A tie that changes nothing is not a problem and is not reported. When the id

// since the freeze" more literally, but it would be WRONG for the remap: a row
// legitimately created during turn 1 and touched during turn 5 would drop out of
// turn 1's re-derived pool entirely, shifting turn 1's numbering away from what
// that turn actually saw and turning correct markers into dropped ones.
// created_at is the field that answers "did this row exist when that turn ran", which

// (it needs a process-local handle counter to be reused, i.e. a restart during a

// the durable fix for both is reading the frozen per-run manifests, which needs

// executePipeline exists to DISCOVER channels and FETCH raw messages. A finalize

// session, and the handler already validated they exist. Running the fetch
// pipeline for it would perform channel discovery against imDB, participant
// intersection, a full intent-recognition tool call, and a message fetch over a
// zero-width time range — paying exactly the cost this feature exists to avoid,
// and it could fail the finalize for reasons unrelated to finalizing.
//
// So this does only the one thing executePipeline does that finalize also needs:
// nothing. The handler creates the creator participant + a Pending
// personal_result in the SAME transaction as the task, and processTask
// bootstraps them defensively one line after this returns when
// participantCount == 0. Calling bootstrapCreatorParticipant here as well was a
// GUARANTEED unique-key conflict on uk_summary_participant_task_user on every
// finalize run — and bootstrapCreatorParticipant decides insert-vs-conflict via
// result.RowsAffected == 0, the exact DSN-sensitive pattern this PR replaced in
// the handler: under clientFoundRows=true the conflict reports one affected row,
// the reload is skipped, participant.ID stays 0, and the personal_result insert
// writes an orphan with participant_ref_id = 0. Not calling it sidesteps the DSN
// question entirely and loses no coverage.
