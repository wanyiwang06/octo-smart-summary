// recordDiscoveredChannels unions the channels a NARROWING tool just chose as the
// run's scope onto the run row, so the finish gate can detect an open-scope
// under-fetch.
//
// Why this exists: for an open-scope run (no UI channel picker) the Spec pins no
// channels, so the gate's expected-vs-fetched comparison had nothing to compare
// and every such run reported COMPLETE — including one that narrowed to 12
// channels and fetched 2. The narrowing tools (narrow_channels_by_topic /
// find_shared_channels) are the only place that knows what "everything in scope"
// meant. list_channels calls it only when commit_scope=true explicitly declares
// that the whole visible surface is the requested scope; ordinary exploratory
// listing remains excluded so topic-based runs do not gain false coverage gaps.
//
// Best-effort and V2-gated, exactly like the coverage recording in fetch_channel:
// this is observability for the verdict, never a reason to fail a tool call. The
// write uses WithoutCancel for the same reason fetch_channel's does — the losses
// worth recording are often the ones that come with a canceled context.
