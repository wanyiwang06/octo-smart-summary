// recordDiscoveredChannels records the final model-declared channel scope on
// the run row, so the finish gate can detect an open-scope under-fetch.
//
// Why this exists: for an open-scope run (no UI channel picker) the Spec pins no
// channels, so the gate's expected-vs-fetched comparison had nothing to compare
// and every such run reported COMPLETE — including one that selected 12
// channels and fetched 2. Discovery candidates are deliberately not recorded:
// only set_summary_scope owns the final selection and therefore the expected
// coverage set.
//
// Best-effort and V2-gated, exactly like the coverage recording in fetch_channel:
// this is observability for the verdict, never a reason to fail a tool call. The
// write uses WithoutCancel for the same reason fetch_channel's does — the losses
// worth recording are often the ones that come with a canceled context.
