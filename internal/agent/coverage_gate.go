// SS-12-b — pre-freeze coverage gate.
//
// WHY THIS LIVES HERE AND NOT AROUND THE RUN
//
// SS-05 freezes the run's citation manifest on the FIRST summarize_chunk call,
// and applyFrozenManifest is explicit that "messages fetched AFTER the freeze
// are not in the manifest and are dropped from the citable pool". That single
// fact decides where a coverage check can possibly work:
//
//   - AFTER the answer (the loop this replaces): a repair fetch is post-freeze
//     by construction. Its messages all miss the manifest, assignCitationIndexes
//     drops them, summarize_chunk reports 无可总结内容 + dropped_count, and the
//     model dutifully tells the user that channel was empty. The gap is not
//     closed, it is replaced by a false statement — and by a vaguer verdict,
//     because the channel is now in succeeded_channels so the gate's precise
//     "expected channel was not fetched" becomes a dropped-messages gap.
//   - BEFORE the freeze (here): the missing fetch is still free. Everything the
//     planner fetches in response is in the pool the manifest is frozen FROM, so
//     the repaired channel's messages are citable — which is the entire point.
//
// So the gate does not weaken the freeze-once invariant; it only chooses a
// better MOMENT to freeze. The mechanism is SS-07b's structured tool error: a
// retryable, non-fatal envelope naming what is missing, which the SS-12 §5
// prompt already teaches the planner to act on ("retryable → fix the args and
// retry the same tool").
